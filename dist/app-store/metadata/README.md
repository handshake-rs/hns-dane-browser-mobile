# App Store metadata

This directory is the reviewed source for the first iOS App Store record. It is not uploaded automatically by the TestFlight workflow.

## App record

- Platform: iOS
- Name: `HNS DANE Browser`
- Primary language: English (U.S.)
- Bundle ID: `com.denuoweb.hnsdane.ios`
- SKU: `hns-dane-browser-ios`
- Apple Team ID: `45NQQK3G3S`
- User access: Full Access
- Version: `0.5.2`
- Build: `46`
- Primary category: Utilities
- Price: Free

The first release is iPhone-only. Native iPad support can be enabled in a later version after adding iPad screenshots and validation coverage.

## First-release fields

Paste these public fields from `en-US/` into the `0.5.2` version record:

- `name.txt`
- `subtitle.txt`
- `promotional-text.txt`
- `description.txt`
- `keywords.txt`
- `support-url.txt`
- `marketing-url.txt`
- `copyright.txt`

Set `privacy-policy-url.txt` under **App Privacy**, not on the version page. Paste
`review-notes.txt` into **App Review Information → Notes**. Leave **What's New in
This Version** empty: App Store Connect does not expose that field for an app's
first release. `whats-new.txt` is retained only as a draft for a later update.

Store approved iPhone screenshots in `../screenshots/en-US/`, numbered in display
order (`01-...`, `02-...`, and so on). Use one exact approved 6.9-inch or 6.5-inch
resolution for the set and do not include an alpha channel.

Run the deterministic package checks before entering metadata, and run the full
check again after screenshots are added:

```sh
python3 dist/app-store/validate.py --metadata-only
python3 dist/app-store/validate.py
```

## Before submission

1. Publish the current cross-platform privacy policy at the URL in `en-US/privacy-policy-url.txt`.
2. Complete App Store Connect's app-privacy, age-rating, content-rights, and export-compliance questionnaires from the app's actual behavior. Do not answer the encryption question by assumption: the Rust runtime implements industry-standard TLS, DNSSEC, and DANE cryptography outside Apple's operating-system crypto APIs.
3. Generate current iPhone simulator screenshots from the iOS shell. Do not reuse Android screenshots.
4. If an iPhone tester becomes available, run an optional external-TestFlight pass. An owned or borrowed iPhone is not an App Store submission requirement; record the simulator-only limitation when no tester is available.
5. Supply App Review with the notes in `en-US/review-notes.txt`; no login is required.
6. Complete every item in `../submission-checklist.md`, select build `46`, and choose manual release before adding the version for review.

The API private key used by CI must exist only in the protected GitHub `app-store` environment and must never be committed or uploaded as a workflow artifact.
