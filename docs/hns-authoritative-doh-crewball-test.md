# HNS Authoritative DoH Crewball Test

This is the live-test runbook for proof-anchored bootstrap or RFC 9461 DNS-server SVCB discovery of an RFC 8484 authoritative DoH endpoint for a delegated HNS nameserver.

## Model

The HNS resource stays a delegation, not an origin-answer capsule:

```text
crewball. delegates to ns1.crewball.
ns1.crewball. has GLUE4 <nameserver-ip>
crewball. has DS <child-zone-ds>
crewball. may have TXT "hnsdns=1;ns=ns1.crewball.;doh=https://crewball:8443/dns-query;tlsa=3,1,1,<spki-sha256>"
_dns.ns1.crewball. has SVCB 1 doh.example. alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns}
```

The browser resolves in this order:

```text
1. Verify the HNS proof for crewball.
2. Extract NS, GLUE4/GLUE6 or SYNTH4/SYNTH6, DS, and any `hnsdns=1` transport declaration from the HNS resource.
3. Query the authoritative nameserver directly over UDP/TCP 53 and validate the response against the HNS-proven DS.
4. A positive matching reply to the bounded TEST-NET canary classifies port 53 as intercepted, stops futile TCP and remaining direct-server attempts, and continues to proof-pinned owner ADoH. Ordinary direct transport failure can also continue to ADoH. The HNS-proven glue remains the connect address, and `tlsa=3,1,1,...` authenticates the endpoint without ICANN DNS or WebPKI.
5. A timeout or inconclusive canary is neither proof that port 53 is clean nor authenticated DNS absence and does not classify the path as intercepted.
6. When direct authority is usable, the browser may query `_dns.ns1.crewball. SVCB`, require `alpn=h2` plus `dohpath`, and validate any discovered endpoint through the delegated DNSSEC chain.
7. If the allowed owner paths fail with typed transport unavailability, try
   the requester-only P2P relay when opted in, then the separately configured
   recursive HNS DoH endpoint when present. DNS response, DNSSEC, or local
   chain/proof failures do not open either transport.
8. Validate every DNSKEY, A/AAAA, HTTPS, and TLSA answer against the HNS-proven
   DS regardless of transport; resolver AD is never trust evidence.
```

The TXT/SVCB metadata only declares nameserver transport. It cannot contain or synthesize origin A/AAAA, HTTPS, or TLSA data.

## HNS Resource Shape

Use this shape after the child DNSSEC zone and nameserver are ready:

```json
{
  "records": [
    { "type": "NS", "ns": "ns1.crewball." },
    { "type": "GLUE4", "ns": "ns1.crewball.", "address": "<nameserver-ipv4>" },
    { "type": "DS", "keyTag": 29398, "algorithm": 13, "digestType": 2, "digest": "<sha256-digest>" },
    { "type": "TXT", "txt": ["hnsdns=1;ns=ns1.crewball.;transport=doh;doh=https://crewball:8443/dns-query;tlsa=3,1,1,<spki-sha256>"] }
  ]
}
```

Keep the serialized resource under the HNS 512-byte resource limit and keep the entire declaration in one TXT character-string of at most 255 bytes. The `tlsa` value is the browser's proof-bootstrap convention using standard TLSA `3/1/1` semantics: DANE-EE, SPKI, SHA-256. It is not a DNS TLSA RR. One additional `tlsa=3,1,1,...` field may be included during key rollover. Publish both old and new pins before changing the served key, wait for the HNS update and resolver caches to advance, switch the endpoint key, and remove the old pin in a later update. A malformed, unsupported, or excess pin is an authenticated-data failure and fails closed; it is not permission to use P2P or configured recursive recovery.

## Authoritative Zone Shape

If you also want signed-zone service metadata, publish it as an optional consistency record:

```zone
_dns.ns1.crewball. 3600 IN SVCB 1 doh.example. alpn=h2 dohpath=/dns-query{?dns}
_8443._tcp.crewball. 3600 IN TLSA 3 1 1 <spki-sha256>
```

The `_8443._tcp.crewball.` TLSA RR is not used to bootstrap proof-pinned ADoH; the verified HNS `tlsa=` field does that without an authoritative DNS bootstrap query. Website DANE remains a separate `_443._tcp.crewball.` TLSA RR, or the TLSA owner for whatever web-origin port HTTPS/SVCB selects.
The `_dns` SVCB line shows the older optional RFC 9461/WebPKI discovery path; it is not required by the HNS-only proof-pinned setup above.

The browser evaluates supported protocols in the effective RFC 9460 HTTPS
ALPN set as `h3`, `h2`, then `http/1.1`; the HTTP/1.1 scheme default applies
unless `no-default-alpn` is present. HTTP/3 derives `_443._udp.crewball.`;
HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 derive `_443._tcp.crewball.`. Only securely authenticated
TLSA absence may advance to the next protocol. Bogus or indeterminate DNSSEC
never becomes “no TLSA,” while a valid UDP TLSA keeps HTTP/3 selected.

## Endpoint Checks

The endpoint is RFC 8484 DoH: HTTPS, path `/dns-query`, DNS wire-format request/response bodies, and `Content-Type: application/dns-message`.

Example POST check:

```sh
NAME=crewball
NS=crewball
IP=<nameserver-ipv4>

dig +dnssec +bufsize=1232 "$NAME" A @"$IP"
dig +dnssec +tcp "$NAME" DNSKEY @"$IP"
dig +dnssec "_dns.$NS" SVCB @"$IP"

python3 - <<'PY'
import dns.message

name = "crewball."
query = dns.message.make_query(name, "A", want_dnssec=True)
query.id = 0
open("/tmp/crewball-a-query.bin", "wb").write(query.to_wire())
PY

curl --insecure --http2 --resolve "$NS:8443:$IP" \
  -H 'Accept: application/dns-message' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/dns-message' \
  --data-binary @/tmp/crewball-a-query.bin \
  --output /tmp/crewball-a-response.bin \
  "https://$NS:8443/dns-query"

python3 - <<'PY'
import dns.message

print(dns.message.from_wire(open("/tmp/crewball-a-response.bin", "rb").read()))
PY
```

The `--resolve` flag mirrors the browser's separation of identity from routing: SNI and HTTP authority use the HNS endpoint name, while the TCP connection uses HNS-proven glue. `curl --insecure` checks only endpoint mechanics; independently compute the served certificate's SHA-256 SPKI and compare it with the proof-anchored `tlsa=3,1,1,...` value. The browser performs that comparison during the TLS handshake and does not disable certificate validation.

## Browser Expectations

Test after the update confirms and the tree interval has passed. Exercise the
default direct/owner paths, then explicitly enable each requester recovery
setting to verify the complete ladder:

- `https://crewball/`
- Resolver trace `hnsProof`: `verified`
- Resolver trace `delegation`: `true`
- Resolver trace `authoritativeDns.udp53` or `authoritativeDns.tcp53`: `ok` when port 53 is reachable
- Resolver trace `authoritativeDns.doh`: `ok` when the proof-bootstrapped or RFC 9461-discovered endpoint validated
- Direct authoritative UDP/TCP 53 is attempted first; a proof-pinned endpoint is identified as `HNS-proof TLSA` and follows direct unavailability or failure
- Resolver trace `port53Interception`: `detected` only when a matching reply came from the unroutable TEST-NET sentinel; detection stops futile TCP and remaining direct-server attempts, while timeout, `not_detected`, or another inconclusive result does not classify interception or authenticated absence
- Resolver trace `resolutionSource`: `authoritative_dns` for port 53, or `authoritative_doh` for the encrypted path
- Status: `DANE via ADoH`, `DANE via DNS53`, `DANE via P2P DNS relay`, or
  `DANE via user-configured recovery DoH` must identify the path that supplied
  the locally validated origin TLSA record; certificate-carried proof is
  reported separately as `Stateless DANE`
- DNSSEC: `secure`
- TLS/DANE state: SPKI or certificate match from the exact selected
  `_443._udp.crewball. TLSA` or `_443._tcp.crewball. TLSA` owner
