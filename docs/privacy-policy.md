# HNS DANE Browser Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-07-25

HNS DANE Browser is published by Denuo Web, LLC. For privacy questions or deletion requests, email <info@denuoweb.com> or use the developer contact listed in the app's store listing. Do not post personal information to the public project issue tracker.

## Summary

HNS DANE Browser is a Handshake-first browser for local HNS proofs, authoritative DNS, an HNS P2P DNS relay, RFC 8484 DoH transport, DNSSEC, and DANE diagnostics. The app does not include advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, developer-operated accounts, or paid feature unlocks. The Android edition may show an optional external donation link that does not unlock functionality; the iOS app has no donation or payment flow.

The app stores browser data locally on the device and sends network requests needed to load sites and keep HNS resolution data current.

## Data Stored Locally

The app may store the following data on the device:

- Browsing history and navigation state: page URLs, page titles, visit times, or the current session's back-forward list, depending on the platform.
- Website data: cookies and other storage managed by Android WebView or Apple WebKit.
- Downloads: files saved at your request and platform-specific local records needed to complete or present those downloads. Android records may include the URL, file name, MIME type, DownloadManager ID, and queued time; iOS saves completed files in the app's local Documents/Downloads directory until you export or remove the app.
- HNS data: synced headers, peer records (including manually added relay-peer IP endpoints), verified resource values, resolver cache, and resolver diagnostics.
- Settings: homepage, cookie preference, optional HNS P2P DNS relay requester, and related app preferences. Relay consumption is off by default and requires explicit opt-in. Upgrades erase the former public recursive HNS DoH setting and force strict HNS trust; a former compatibility preference is never treated as relay consent.

This local data is used only to provide browser functionality, diagnostics, and HNS resolution. It is not sold. It is not sent to a Denuo Web analytics or advertising service.

## Network Requests

To provide browser functionality, HNS DANE Browser may connect to:

- Websites and web services that you choose to open.
- Handshake peers and DNS seed hosts for header sync, peer discovery, and proof retrieval.
- Relay-capable Handshake peers for recursive HNS DNS queries after local proof validation and authoritative DNS attempts fail, but only after the user opts into requester consumption. Upgrades preserve an independent relay choice and never convert a former public-DoH/compatibility choice into consent. A manual relay peer must be entered as an IP-literal endpoint and is stored only after its live HSD handshake advertises the relay capability. The browser does not become an output node.
- Authoritative DNS nameservers for delegated HNS names.
- Proof-bootstrapped or RFC 9461-discovered RFC 8484 authoritative DoH endpoints for delegated HNS names.
- Security or reputation services exposed by the platform web engine. In particular, an installed Android WebView provider may check URLs with its Safe Browsing service and apply its own privacy policy. Apple WebKit and the operating system may apply their own browser-security protections. HNS DANE Browser does not operate those platform services.
- The non-routable `192.0.2.1` TEST-NET DNS sentinel after delegated DNS failure; a matching reply confirms transparent outbound port 53 interception, while no reply is reported only as not detected.
- Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS service at `cloudflare-dns.com` (bootstrapped through the documented `1.1.1.1` addresses) for ordinary internet DNS resolution.
- Platform download services and the destination you choose when you download or export a file.

These network endpoints may receive technical information that is normal for network communication, such as your IP address, the requested host or URL, protocol metadata, and any data you submit to websites. Cloudflare controls its own resolver logging, retention, and privacy practices; Denuo Web does not operate that service. In particular, an HNS relay peer can observe the queried DNS name and record type together with your P2P connection and network address. An ordinary Handshake TCP connection is not query-confidential; encrypted peer transport should be preferred where available. The relay response is still validated locally through the app's Handshake proof, DNSSEC, TLSA, and DANE checks, and the peer's DNS authenticated-data bit is not trusted.

Public recursive HNS DNS-over-HTTPS and HNS WebPKI fallback are prohibited. HNS uses direct proof-backed resolution, proof-anchored authoritative DoH where declared, and the optional P2P relay, with DNSSEC and DANE validation remaining local. Every complete DNS hostname is also resolved through bounded validating ICANN DoH for dual-root classification; ICANN WebPKI is allowed only after authenticated TLSA denial or a proven unsigned zone.

HTTPS, DNSSEC, and DANE are used where applicable. If you intentionally open a cleartext `http://` site, that site connection is not encrypted by HTTPS.

## Cookies and Website Data

Websites may set cookies or use platform web-engine storage. Android provides settings controls to block third-party cookies and delete cookies plus WebView origin storage. iOS uses a persistent WebKit profile and provides a settings action that deletes its cookies and website data. Remaining website data is removed when the app is uninstalled. Websites are responsible for their own privacy practices.

## Data Sharing

Denuo Web does not sell personal or sensitive user data. HNS DANE Browser shares data only as necessary for user-requested browser functionality, such as loading a website, syncing HNS data, resolving a name, or downloading a file.

## Retention and Deletion

Local browser data remains on the device until you clear it using an available platform/app control or uninstall the app. Android provides controls for clearing cookies and WebView origin storage, browsing history, download records, gateway diagnostics, and the HNS resolver cache; Android system settings can also clear all app storage. iOS provides controls for clearing cookies and WebKit website data, browsing history, download-list records, locally stored gateway diagnostics, and the HNS resolver cache. Clearing the iOS download list does not delete the downloaded files themselves; those app-local files remain until the app is uninstalled. Files you export to another location are then controlled by that destination.

HNS DANE Browser does not create developer-operated user accounts, so there is no app account deletion flow.

## Children

HNS DANE Browser is not directed to children. Because it is a general-purpose browser, websites opened by users may contain third-party content outside Denuo Web's control.

## Changes

This policy may be updated as the app changes. Material privacy changes should be reflected in this file, the in-app privacy text, Google Play's Data safety form, and Apple's App Privacy answers as applicable.
