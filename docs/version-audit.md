# Version Audit

Audit date: 2026-07-10.

This table records the versions actually configured for the shipping build. Android runtime dependencies use stable releases; separate build-tool transitive dependencies may carry preview labels selected by AGP and are not packaged into the app.

Notes:

- AndroidX Activity, Core, and WebKit are pinned to their stable lines. The Gradle lock resolves Core to the same declared `1.18.0` version instead of relying on Activity's transitive upgrade.
- Gradle is pinned to the current `9.6.1` stable patch release, with both distribution and wrapper-JAR checksums verified. AGP is pinned to the current `9.2.1` stable patch release.
- AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin support, so the Android module intentionally does not apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`. See https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-built-in-kotlin.
- DNSSEC RSA/SHA-1 compatibility, ECDSA P-256/SHA-256, ECDSA P-384/SHA-384, RSA/SHA-256, RSA/SHA-512, Ed25519, SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-384 DS/DNSKEY delegation-link validation, RRSIG signed-data, signed DNSKEY RRset, delegated-chain, NSEC no-data/name-range/name-error validation, RFC 5155 NSEC3 no-data/name-error/DS/wildcard/referral validation, RFC 4034 canonical RDATA name handling, and RFC 9460 SVCB/HTTPS RDATA primitives are implemented locally. Remaining DNSSEC algorithms and unknown NSEC3 hash algorithms stay fail-closed until full algorithm and advisory review is complete.
- Urkel proof payload decoding and verification are implemented locally against the upstream `urkel` proof format used by HSD `proof` packets. HSD resource value decoding is implemented locally for DS, NS, GLUE4/GLUE6, SYNTH4/SYNTH6, and TXT records, with resolver adapters plus in-memory and SQLite providers for verified proof values, resource-cache byte accounting, chain-root/height anchoring, current-tip invalidation, active cap enforcement, clear-cache support, and oldest-entry eviction. Header storage validates the exact mainnet genesis header, enforces HSD-compatible mainnet difficulty retarget bits, maintains a canonical hash-by-height index for reorg-aware height lookups, and appends canonical tip updates for normal chain growth. Blocking TCP peer connections cover version/verack, getaddr, getheaders, and getproof flows, with static peer seeding, HSD-compatible DNS seed discovery, bounded peer discovery, address-group diversity, SQLite peer-state persistence, bounded multi-batch header sync, foreground Android scheduling, proof fetching, and verified-resource storage. The gateway routes dotted HNS hosts by their final HNS root label, performs origin-focused A/AAAA and separate HTTPS/SVCB lookups, accepts denial only after DNSSEC validation, supports proof-anchored authoritative DoH plus direct authoritative DNS and the optional P2P relay, and applies strict HNS DNSSEC/DANE without public recursive HNS DoH or HNS WebPKI fallback. It also supports local HNS CONNECT termination with native per-host certificates and HNS WebSocket/HTTP Upgrade tunneling after resolution, HTTPS/SVCB policy, and DANE validation.
- HNS WebSocket/HTTP Upgrade requests are no longer stripped into normal GET requests. They route through the native stream tunnel and still fail closed if the native bridge is unavailable, validation fails, or HTTPS/SVCB policy does not permit HTTP/1.1 for the tunnel. The loopback proxy rejects all non-HNS HTTP, CONNECT, and Upgrade requests; normal ICANN traffic stays on WebView's direct path.
- Native HNS WebView interception can now stream decoded origin response bodies into temporary files and return a fixed-length header block to Android, avoiding the previous all-response byte-array path for bodyless WebView and Service Worker HNS requests. Decoded chunked bodies suppress stale `Transfer-Encoding` and mismatched `Content-Length` before WebView receives them.
- First-run sync now starts automatically from the main browser activity, uses active scheduler intervals while the known or estimated target is ahead of `bestHeight`, uses a 10-minute idle check after catch-up, raises the Android native header batch cap to 192 batches per peer per run, persists and refreshes seeded peers while the peer table is below target, and reports `syncing` instead of `synced` whenever accepted headers still leave the local best height behind the known or estimated target. The main page shows a live-polled block progress bar with stable target wording plus a separate WebView loading bar under the block info, the security status sits left of the omnibox, and back/forward/refresh/settings actions live under a hamburger menu with diagnostic-only status, cookie options, resolver-cache clearing, legal/user-agreement content, source information, and donation links in Settings.
- Gateway-generated HNS error pages now include the requested URL above the status line so repeated 502 validation pages show which address failed.
- Gateway failure diagnostics are now persisted in app-private storage as a bounded, sanitized recent-event log containing only stage, host, status, and reason. URL paths, query strings, headers, and bodies are not written to the default diagnostic log.
- An Android instrumentation test now validates the real HNS CONNECT termination path on-device: the loopback proxy generates a native per-host TLS certificate, completes a TLS handshake, pins the certificate fingerprint for WebView SSL policy, rejects an ICANN URL for that pinned certificate, and forwards a bounded HNS HTTPS POST body through the native gateway bridge.
- Live-device validation on 2026-06-26 confirmed `welcome.2d` is classified and intercepted as HNS, then fails closed as `HNS Nameserver Response Invalid` because the delegated nameserver path does not return usable secure origin data. The same live audit found the supplied `theshake` and `niami` records lack usable secure apex origin address/TLSA responses for this strict gateway path, so their current failures are site/delegation data failures after the gateway address-query fix rather than the previous origin-address-selection bug. Historical evidence from that date also exercised the former Android HNS DoH compatibility resolver; that public recursive path has since been removed and is not a current product capability.
- `rustls` is pinned to the stable `0.23.41` line with the `ring` provider for Android-oriented builds. `cargo search` currently advertises `0.24.0-dev.0` as latest, but this project avoids dev prereleases for transport security code.
- `ring` is pinned to `0.17.14` and reused for DNSSEC RSA, ECDSA P-384/SHA-384, and Ed25519 verification because it is already the rustls crypto provider in this workspace.
- `p256` is pinned to the stable `0.13.2` line because the current crates.io latest advertised by `cargo search` is a `0.14.0-rc` prerelease.
- `rusqlite` is pinned to `0.39.0` in this workspace because `0.40.1` currently pulls a `libsqlite3-sys` build script that fails on the available Rust 1.92 toolchain with an unstable `cfg_select` feature.
