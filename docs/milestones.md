- DNSSEC ECDSA P-384/SHA-384 RRset signature validation.
- DNSSEC RSA/SHA-1 compatibility, RSA/SHA-256, and RSA/SHA-512 RRset signature validation.
- DNSSEC Ed25519 RRset signature validation.
- DNSSEC signed-RRset validator composed from DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG checks.
- DNSSEC delegated-chain validator composed from authenticated DS and DNSKEY RRsets.
- DNSSEC NSEC no-data, name-range, and name-error denial validation.

- Certificate/SPKI extraction.

## Milestone 4: Origin Transport

- Bounded HTTP/1.1 TCP fetch.
- TCP TLS fetch with rustls.
- DNSSEC-gated TLSA/DANE validation during TLS handshake.
- HTTP/2 fetch.
- QUIC/HTTP/3 fetch.

## Milestone 5: Android Browser

- WebView shell.
- ProxyController integration.
- Randomized-port loopback HTTP/CONNECT proxy with native persistent-cache HNS HTTP routing, automatic validating-DoH ICANN TLSA/DANE routing, WebView and Service Worker bodyless HTTP/HTTPS request interception with file-backed decoded response bodies, bounded redirects, bounded header/body forwarding, reserved-name filtering, local HTTPS termination using exact generated-certificate fingerprint pins, public-IP-only opaque CONNECT compatibility, and native WebSocket/HTTP Upgrade stream tunneling with fail-closed fallback when validation or the native bridge is unavailable.
- Packaged Rust JNI library.
- Application-foreground native sync scheduler with in-process status snapshots,
  a first-page progress bar driven by the corroborated effective target,
  diagnostic raw-peer/schedule estimates, short scheduling only after accepted
  header progress, ten-minute current/no-progress checks, a separate WebView
  loading bar, hamburger back/forward/refresh/settings menu, Settings
  diagnostics, manual sync triggering, explicit
  syncing/up-to-date/peer-failed outcomes, and per-peer failure stages.
- HNS omnibox rules.
- Security and diagnostics UI.

## Milestone 6: Hardening

- Enforced cache caps, current-tip cache invalidation, clear-cache action, and cache-size diagnostics.
- Device matrix.
- Fuzzing expansion.
- Battery and network optimization.
- Security review.

## Milestone 7: Shared Runtime and Apple Shell

- Moved persistent runtime ownership, policy, synchronization, cache, diagnostics, gateway, proxy, HTTP parsing, CONNECT termination, certificate generation, and Upgrade tunneling behind JNI-free Rust APIs.
- Replaced the Android Kotlin proxy/TLS/WebSocket stack with the shared Rust proxy while preserving the Android behavior and release-validation baseline.
- Added authenticated whole-browser proxy routing in which every canonical DNS hostname enters one retained full-host dual-root plan. HNS and ICANN are resolved independently; DNS-named HTTPS/WSS CONNECT is locally terminated and uses automatic transport-aware TLSA discovery, DANE when secure TLSA is present, and WebPKI only for authenticated ICANN absence or proven insecure delegation. Public IP literals retain bounded opaque CONNECT. HTTP forwarding, Upgrade tunneling, and special-address/unsafe-port policy do not use system target resolution.
- Added the stable versioned `ios-ffi` C ABI, C/C++ header checks, Apple Rust slices, and XCFramework build scripts.
- Added the iOS 17.0-or-later UIKit/WKWebView shell with persistent profile data, authenticated no-failover whole-data-store proxying, generation-safe scope rotation, exact Rust-authorized HNS certificate handling, lifecycle revocation, downloads, and shared snapshot bootstrap.
- Added the macOS ABI, XCFramework, application, and simulator test gate against the stable iOS 26.5 SDK, accepting Xcode 26.5 or 26.6. The iOS 17.0 deployment floor, including support for the iOS 18 generation, remains independent of that build SDK.
- Optional additional gate: run and document the signed physical-device WebKit matrix for main frames, subresources, Service Workers, WebSockets, downloads, background/resume, and renderer/network-process restart. No physical-device result is claimed; Linux and simulator checks do not provide that hardware-specific evidence.
- Removed the single-host ICANN DANE exception and applied the automatic policy to Android and iOS navigation, redirects, subresources, WebSockets, supported Service Worker requests, and downloads. Portable coverage is checked in; Android/iOS device qualification remains open.
